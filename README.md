# SuperHot Base Using Unreal Blueprint

**SuperHot Base Using Unreal Blueprint** is a project that recreates the core mechanics of the game "SuperHot" using Unreal Engine Blueprints. This project emphasizes advanced gameplay programming, time manipulation mechanics, and interactive environment creation within Unreal Engine.

## Key Components

### Blueprints
- **TimeController Blueprint:** Manages the game's time manipulation mechanics, slowing down time when the player is stationary and speeding up as they move.
- **PlayerController Blueprint:** Handles player inputs, movements, and interactions with the environment.
- **EnemyController Blueprint:** Implements enemy AI behaviors, including pathfinding and combat logic.

### Game Mechanics
- **Time Manipulation:** Core mechanic that alters the flow of time based on player movement.
- **Combat System:** Includes shooting mechanics and enemy interactions.
- **Interactive Environment:** Features objects that react to the player's actions and time changes.

## Features

- **Advanced Time Control:** Utilizes Unreal Engine's capabilities to create a unique time manipulation mechanic.
- **Dynamic AI:** Enemy AI that responds to player actions and environmental changes.
- **Blueprint Scripting:** Demonstrates complex gameplay mechanics using Unreal Engine Blueprints for visual scripting.

This project serves as an advanced example for developers interested in creating innovative gameplay mechanics and dynamic AI using Unreal Engine Blueprints.
